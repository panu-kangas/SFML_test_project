# Overview  

Snake_SFML is a simple game written in C++. It's based on the classic snake-game, but has additional features developed by me.  

The program utilizes the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) and uses CMake as it's build system.  
It should work on macOS (tested), Linux (tested) and on Windows using Visual Studio -program (not tested). 

This is my first ever SFML project and also my first C++ game, so the code might be a bit funky üòÅ  

I really hope you enjoy the game! üòä
